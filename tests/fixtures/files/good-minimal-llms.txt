# AI SDK

> The AI SDK is a provider-agnostic TypeScript toolkit for building AI-powered applications and agents with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and other JavaScript runtimes.

Use this page to find current AI SDK documentation. Prefer search results and targeted Markdown pages over loading the full documentation bundle.

## Web Access

If you can fetch URLs, search the docs first:

- Search endpoint: https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=your+query

Examples:

- https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=building+agents
- https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=ToolLoopAgent
- https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=prepareStep
- https://ai-sdk.dev/api/search-docs?q=generating+structured+output

The search endpoint returns JSON with documentation URLs. Fetch the returned URLs with `.md` appended to get Markdown content.

## Local Coding Agents

If you are working inside a local coding project with filesystem access, install the AI SDK skill first:

```sh
npx skills add vercel/ai
```

Then follow the skill instructions before changing code.
